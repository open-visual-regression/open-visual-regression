### Minor Changes

- [#189](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/pull/189) [`bf346a2`](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/commit/bf346a26490a2b02589f94ce714dd8ac54cebf94) Thanks [@tgfischer](https://github.com/tgfischer)! - Show a skipped story on the build as `skipped`.

  A story with `parameters.ovr.skip` produced no snapshot at all, so it vanished
  from the build with nothing to say it had ever been there. It now gets one
  snapshot per story, in a new `skipped` status: nothing is captured, diffed, or
  queued for review, but the story is visible on the build, in the status filter,
  and in the build's snapshot counts.

  The diff-completion check ignores skipped snapshots, so they neither hold a
  build open nor get swept up when one is canceled or reaped.

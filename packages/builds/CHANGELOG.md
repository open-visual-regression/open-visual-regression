### Patch Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/pull/157) [`fed2be3`](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/commit/fed2be3a3af19ae4f7ff3dd764e0905128f33855) Thanks [@tgfischer](https://github.com/tgfischer)! - Download a build's Storybook bundle once per worker instead of once per capture group.

  Capture groups each extracted the build artifact into their own temporary
  directory and deleted it when the group finished, so a build split into 18
  groups pulled the whole bundle out of object storage 18 times. On remote S3
  that download, and the untar behind it, ran before the first screenshot of
  every group.

  Both the extract job and the capture groups now go through the Storybook
  bundle cache the dashboard already used, so a build is fetched once per worker
  and reused. Bundles still in use are exempt from cache eviction, so a capture
  group cannot lose the files its browser is serving. `OVR_STORYBOOK_CACHE_BYTES`
  (`worker.storybookCacheBytes` in the chart) caps what the cache keeps on disk.

### Patch Changes

- [#139](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/pull/139) [`81b2201`](https://github.com/open-visual-regression/open-visual-regression/commit/81b220148f98e4e35ac49462af112719c088d1ff) Thanks [@tgfischer](https://github.com/tgfischer)! - Route all remaining logging through the shared application logger.

  better-auth wrote to its own console logger, and the worker, the builds
  retention module and bull-board wrote to `console` directly. That output
  ignored `LOG_LEVEL` and did not match the structured format everything else
  emits. It now goes through `@ovr/logger`.

  The `ovr` CLI and the database migrate script still write to `console`, since
  that output is the program's own interface rather than logging.
